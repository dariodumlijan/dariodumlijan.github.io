Hi, Iâ€™m Dario, a full-stack engineer from Zagreb, Croatia.

I have over <script>document.write(Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - new Date(2021, 8, 1).getTime()) / 3.154e+10))</script> years of professional programming experience and have had the pleasure of working on various projects ranging from small start-ups to large corporates as well as small and large teams where my roles evolved over time all the way to team lead.

In my free time I have created 2 mobile applications both compatible with Android and iOS, one of which has accumulated over 6k downloads.
