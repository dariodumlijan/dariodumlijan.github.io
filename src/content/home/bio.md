Hi, Iâ€™m Dario, a full-stack engineer from Zagreb, Croatia.

I have over <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2021)</script> years of professional programming experience and have had the pleasure of working on various projects ranging from small start-ups to large corporates as well as small and large teams where my roles evolved over time all the way to team lead.

In my free time I have created 2 mobile applications both compatible with Android and iOS, one of which has accumulated over 6k downloads.
