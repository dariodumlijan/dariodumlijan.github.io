### A new fresh way to visualise beats and rhythms as well as create them. With Ritmo, creating exciting, different more complex beats is super easy.

Easy to use, user-friendly interface:

-   10 different sound library (Acoustic, Trap, Lo-fi and more) - more to come
-   3 time signatures (adjustable for each sound "kick/snare/hi-hat")
-   An adjustable BPM
-   Presets
-   Export as MIDI

Ritmo is a redefined beatmaker. It is meant to help people create new and interesting beats/rhythms in a way they never made them before. Encouraging the user to think of a beat as a circle instead of a straight path, you can more easily see and find new possibilities.

The app allows the user to create a simple beat and then start rotating (offsetting) different parts to create new more interesting and less common rhythms. Once the user starts playing around and thinking of the beat more visually as a circle, even the complex polyrhythms start to make sense and are easier to accomplish, especially with the feature of selecting inputs that are from different time signatures.

The app has an adjustable BPM, a selection of different time signatures and multiple sound libraries that give the user all of the freedom to create whatever they want.
