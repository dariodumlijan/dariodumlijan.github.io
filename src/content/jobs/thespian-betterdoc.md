Collaborated with a medium-large engineering team to develop and maintain an internal e-health software platform, powered by 40+ microservices running on Kubernetes clusters within AWS infrastructure.

Designed and implemented patient-facing services for creating and managing online surveys/questionnaires, enabling data collection, processing, and automation across multiple system components.

Developed an intuitive admin interface for configuring surveys and integrated the survey platform with partner applications to ensure seamless interoperability.

Contributed to the transition from legacy Ruby services to new Elixir-based microservices, including synchronization and phased decommissioning of outdated systems.
