Designed and developed an enterprise-level dispatching application for monitoring and reporting real-time bus events.

Implemented a robust role-based permission system to control access to actions, data, and specific application pages based on user roles.

Collaborated directly with stakeholders, delivering in-person and online presentations of new features and designs.

Operated within a small, agile three-person team, progressively taking on increased responsibilities and autonomy. By the project's conclusion, independently managed all communication, task execution, and decision-making without supervision.
